![SimRIS Logo](corelab_beyaz.jpg) <!-- Replace with your logo or a relevant image -->

Welcome to the SimRIS Channel Simulator v2.0 repository! This open-source and user-friendly simulator is designed for accurate physical channel modeling of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS)-empowered networks. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or enthusiast in the field of wireless communication, SimRIS v2.0 is here to support your studies and experiments.

## Key Features

- Comprehensive simulation of RIS-empowered networks' physical channel characteristics.
- Consideration of LOS probabilities, array responses, path loss, shadowing models, and environmental factors.
- Support for indoor and outdoor environments (Indoor Hotspot and Urban Microcellar) across popular mmWave frequencies (28 GHz and 73 GHz).
- MIMO terminal support with different array types (Uniform Linear Array and Uniform Planar Array).
- User-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) for scenario setup and customization.
- Generation of channel matrices (H, G, D) through Monte Carlo simulations for specified realizations.
- Open-source and written in MATLAB for easy accessibility and contribution.

## Getting Started
